        <!-- <h1>VR32:</h1> -->
        <p>The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a console developed in the early 90's. It was the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. Developed over 4 years and referred to as the VR32 this console was ahead of the game. Unfortunatly it wasnt as big a success as Nintendo had hoped and was scrapped in 1996.
            The console was a portable headset and controller that required 6AA batteries. For some of us the dream didnt die in 1996, and we are here to keep it alive.</p>
